                <p>Pokemon Arceus much like Elden Ring is taking a new direction in the series while still keeping core elements from the series. Pokemon games have long had a formula for the game. Basically, find pokemon, go beat trainers and then become the best. Everything was sort of area-based. In comparison, Arceus is going to be a completely open world with a much more intimate view of the character. This breaks the usual top-down style that has been so custom to Pokemon games. Fans are excited about this game because they had been worried about the series becoming too stale. As always, games like this are a risk and often can seriously hurt a series if it goes wrong. Despite the risks, many believe this is going to be the best Pokemon game yet.</p>
