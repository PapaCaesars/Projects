                <h3> About</h3>
                <p> FromSoftware has had a killer record these last 10 years. They have won game of the year on three of their titles: Sekiro, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3. It is no surprise that people are extremely excited for their next release coming out in just one month. The game is similar in nature to Dark Souls. It is a midevil fantasy game with roots in gothic nature. The largest difference between the games is the open world concept FromSoftware is trying out. People are skeptical about this because of how it goes against the great formula they had and how other games like Halo Infinite suffered because of it. Nonetheless, people remain hopeful in Elden Ring because FromSoftware is a great company. </p>
