                <h3> About</h3>
                <p> Breath of the Wild 2 is the sequal to one of the best modern videogames. Long awaited, this game seems to keep most of the same visuals and gameplay of the original. However, there are new exciting elements like grapling and new skills that will spice up game play. People are most excited for the continuation of the story as the last game had an extremely immersive world.
                    People believe that Ganon will resurrect his body as only his malice was released in the original. This is just speculation though, because
                    we don't have much information to go off of, other than small cinematics.
